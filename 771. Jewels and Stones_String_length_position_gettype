771. Jewels and Stones
You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

 

Example 1:

Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
Output: 0


class Solution {

    /**
     * @param String $jewels
     * @param String $stones
     * @return Integer
     */
    function numJewelsInStones($jewels, $stones) {
        $count = 0;
        for ($i=0; $i<strlen($stones); $i++){
            if (gettype(strpos($jewels, $stones[$i]))=="integer")
            $count++;
        }
        return $count;
    }
}
